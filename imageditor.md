This editor works on any JPEG/JPG, PNG, GIF or SVG images.  **Make sure the file ends with the file extension or the JavaScript library will not be able to load the images. The JavaScript library does not support GIFs so any annotations done with GIF should be for own purposes.**.

### To use `embed tags` copy tag and feed into [html escape](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-escape.html). Click `escape` button and copy output into text box.
